# BAXA3-Drugs

Features 7 new experimental drugs that are a marine's favorite pre-battle snack.

## How-To

These drugs were developed using a new chemical called Experiphrine. When taking any of these drugs, varying levels of experiphrine (EXP2) will be absorbed into the body. The body's safe limit is 10 milliliters. Inject too much, and there may be fatal consequences. So make sure to teach your soldiers about the safe limits of these drugs.
